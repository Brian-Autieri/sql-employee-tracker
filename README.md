# SQL Employee Tracker

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a command-line application that allows the user to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. The user is able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in the company, and is able to add departments, roles, and employees, as well as update employee roles.

## Usage

Users can use this application by installing the required dependencies and running the application from the command line. The user will be presented with a series of prompts that will allow them to view, add, and update the company's employee database.
